GIT BRANCHING TUTORIAL

git branch branchName //To create a new branch
git checkout branchName //To switch to the branch you want
git status //To see on which branch you are
git branch --list //Gets all the branches

so this branch is created in local machine we can either manually create a branch in the github or we can
use the command git push --set-upstream origin branchName
